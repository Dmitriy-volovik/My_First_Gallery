# Gallery
<h2>Test project - Gallery using Express/React/Redux/Node/MySQL/GraphQL </h2>
<p> This is my first major application. It has several drawbacks that I took into account when creating a new application. For several reasons, I can not yet make a demo link for this application. But I'm working on it. For now, you can see the work on video</p>
<h2>This app provides the following features:</h2>	
<ul>
	<li>User can upload images to album </li>
	<li>User can remove image from album </li>
	<li>User can add New Album </li>
	<li>when you hover over an album, the images scroll</li>
	<li>Events only between 8am to 5pm </li>
	<li>Conflicting events have the same width, and not overlap</li>
</ul>

	<li>restructure the code for better readability using - "best practice"</li>
